Do you believe that society should be fair?
That playing by the rule is ethical?
That you deserves to be where you are today?

For most of us, our belief system is largely unconscious, or at least not clearly articulated.
Yet these beliefs influence our thought patterns as well as our behavior.

And beliefs don't just drive individual behaviours.
In many ways, a society also operates under a set of underlying beliefs (and myths), which individuals can individually or collectively shape. 

This brings me to my new ttRPG 'meta-module' [Catalyst](/games/catalyst).
In many games, RPG characters are heroes or larger-than-life characters at the center of pivotal events and epic stories. 
How do your characters' beliefs evolve based on their choices, wins, and losses? 
And, in turn, how do your characters' beliefs shape the broader setting in which they evolve?

I hope you will enjoy exploring these questions through my new module.
