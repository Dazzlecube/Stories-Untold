Initiative is a divisive mechanics. On the positive side it provides a clear structure for who can act when. On the down side, it tends to add a layer of complexity and to slow down the action. 

Many games have kept the concept while simplifying it, for example assigning a unique number to all players and one to their opponent. Alternatively, some games have replaced it completely, for example using narrative or using meta currencies to order turns and actions.

Here I want to discuss a third option: Making Initiative a core and strategic aspect of the combat mechanics. 

In [Exalted](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/162759/Exalted-3rd-Edition), initiative is a resource that represents not only your ability to act before others, but also the relative advantage you have against your opponents (think better positioning for example). You gain or lose initiative based on your actions, and can unleash so-called decisive attacks by spending your initiative. However, loose too much initiative and you'll end up being vulnerable. This system offers tactical depth and reflects well the heroic, martial art inspired type of action of the setting.

In [Circle of Hands](https://www.nobleknight.com/P/2147573170/Circle-of-Hands), initiative is a dynamic and strategic variable. All contestants are placed around a circle. The order will change according to each player action and reaction (e.g., defending against an attack or trying to counterattack). And all players can decide to act at any time. This system makes for a very strategic approach to combat and has the advantage of crystalizing the attention of the whole table around a single concept.

In [Shinogigami](https://shinobigami.com/), each player can decide its 'speed' at each tuen. Speed determines the order of action as well as, in combination with the type of attack used, which other contestants are within reach. However, going at high speeds comes with an increase chance of Fumble. This risk-reward tradeoff and effective positioning component adds a strategic layer to the action and fit perfectly with what we expect from superhuman ninjas.

All these examples show that it is possible to take a 'clunky' mechanics and turn it into something unique and thematically appropriate. So while I'm a big advocate of streamlined design, it is worth thinking twice before completely removing a mechnics and check whether there is an opportunity to turn it into something else entirely.
