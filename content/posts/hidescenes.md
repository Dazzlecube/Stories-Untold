We designers invest a lot in crafting unique elements in our games. 
The clever puzzle. 
The defining moment between two characters.
And, naturally, we want our players to see it. 

Yet, this sometimes leads to some awkward design to make the players see how clever we are or how much resources we invested. 
Players suddenly lose agency, with a cutscene popping up or with suddenly a restricted set of options available. 
Or maybe our companion not-so-subtly encourage us to go explore a certain area.

At the opposite, some games hide their best moments.
Take *Final Fantasy 6* for example. 
In a completely optional scene (let's call it the "coin flip scene"), you learn about two characters' past and how they came to be the way they are. 
It brings new depth to their personalities and relationship.

Similar in *Chrono Trigger*. 
Even though I played it as a child, I still vividly remember one particular scene where all protagonists gather around the campfire. 
It has character development, musings on the nature of time and fate, and a pivotal jump back to the past sparked by memories of a tragedy.

And yet all of these scenes were optional. And not only optional, their existence was not telegraphed in any way. 
You get to discover them. in a way to is consistent with the game world, by being at the right place and at the right time.
And that makes it all the more special and precious. 

Plus, these scenes bring genuine replay value.

You know the adage *Show, don't tell/ *. Maybe it's time to occasionally replace it by *Hide, don't show*.
