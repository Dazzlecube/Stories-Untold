When you pick up a fight - whether in the form of a negotiation, a family disupte or an actual brawl - you have decided this was something worth fighting for. 
Some underlying beliefs about yourself or society (whether as it is today or as it ought to be) are driving this will to fight. 

In many games, RPG characters are heroes or larger-than-life characters at the center of pivotal events and epic stories. 
Their actions and underlying beliefs will drastically influence their in-game communities and societies. 
So, how do your character’s beliefs impact her actions and evolve based on their choices, wins, and losses? And, in turn, how do your characters’ beliefs shape the broader setting in which they evolve?

This module will help explore these questions and bring new depth to your characters by offering simple rules that can be added to most gaming systems. 


## The rules


Each character can have up to six core beliefs, three about herself and three about the world in which she evolves.
As the game progresses, your character will pick up new beliefs and let go of old ones. 

Each belief is characterized by a *Conviction* level. 
*Conviction* is measured in levels from one to six, with one a barely conscious or articulated belief and six representing the core pillar of a character's identity. 

A new character can start with up to four beliefs, with chosen *Conviction* levels. 
A character with zero beliefs is still trying to find its own path and place in the world, while a character with four or more beliefs has a strong sense of self and purpose.

> *"It's not what you fight, but what you fight for"*. David Peterson, The Mouse Guard.

Each time a character engages in a meaningful conflict or emotional moment, select the belief that underpins her behavior or reaction. 
If no belief is applicable, create a new one with a *Conviction* level of two.

Invoking a belief brings a bonus to your character's actions for the scene. 
The exact bonus will be game dependent, with the Game Master having the final say on its importance. 
For example, a belief could add an advantage bonus in a D&D game, or extra dice in other systems.

If the overall scene resolves in the characters' favor, increase the relevant belief's conviction level by one. 
If the scene turns against the character's intent, her belief is shaken and its *Conviction* level decreases by one.
If a belief reaches a *Conviction* level of zero, it is abandoned. 
If it reaches a *Conviction* level of six, it is now an immutable part of your character and cannot be altered anymore.

At the end of a game session or campaign, reflect on how a character's beliefs will further shape her future actions, and in particular her impact on the game world.
Maybe a hero's underlying beliefs will inspire a followership or legacy that will end up destroying the realm or society she fought so hard to protect in the first place. 
Maybe the core beliefs that surfaced along the game will shift a character's actions to turn against its mentor or initial employer.

Play out these story opportunities in full and leave them as potential futures for your character.

## Examples of character's beliefs

**Beliefs abouth the self**
- I need to earn my place and success in the world
- I can never fully respect someone who has not earned its place the hard way
- I am [not] as talented as what people believe me to be
- I am deserving of love
