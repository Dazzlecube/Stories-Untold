description: We Don't Have to be Stuck. Ordinary people can change the world.

The stories we tell ourselves shape our thinking and sense of possibilities. 

Take neocapitalism for example, which is touted as having no alternative. 
Yet, in *"The Dawn to Everything: A New History of Humanity"*, David Graeber and David Wengrow upend bedrock assumptions about 30,000 years of change. They show that, contrary to what many people believe, there are alternatives to neoliberal capitalism. 

And the same happens in science, arts, or even personal development: The dominant - and our own -  narratives are limiting our options and imagination.
 
I believe that exploring alternative narratives can unlock new ideas, projects, and outcomes. 
In this blog I celebrate the untold stories of outliers, rebels, and innovators, and share some of my own reflections and creations.
