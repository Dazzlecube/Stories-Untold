Hi, I'm David. I'm a father of 2 kids. I grew up and currently live in Belgium, but I had the chance to live in the US and in Japan. I'm interested in a variety of topics, from physics to the role of power in modern capitalism.

As a scientist, I authored one book and 30+ research papers in statistical physics and thermodynamics, inspiring research that continues today (1200+ citations, 100+ last year). I obtained a **PhD in Physics** from the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and a **Postdoc in Computational Neuroscience** from Yale University. I received multiple awards, such as the Ilya Priogine Prize for thermodynamics and FNRS grants.

I also worked in various business and leadership roles. I worked in the software industry, and I'm an **experienced McKinsey consultant** in strategy and sustainability, advising clients in the tech and agriculture sectors. 

Finally, one of my long time passion is **game design**, from board games to video games and tabletop role-playing games. I'm now dedicating time to write and publish my game projects.
